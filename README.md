## Introduction
This repository contain the project work done for 'Data Science in Action' course in cooperation with Unieuro, an Italian retail chain specializing in the sale of consumer electronics, household appliances, and technology products.

The goal of this project is to build a statistical model able to predict the sales units for each product featured in promotional flyers in November 2023 and December 2023.
Through many steps of data cleaning and data manipulation, we are able to implement and evaluate three different statistical models to find the most suitable one.
